# {frontmatter.title}

As a software engineering student at the University of Calgary, I’ve spent the few years of my degree diving into a broad range of topics, each shaping my understanding of how software works. One area that continually stands out to me is the importance of low-level concepts. These fundamental principles are the very core of software engineering, the building blocks upon which everything else is constructed.

While learning these concepts, I noticed that the connections between them weren’t always immediately clear. It wasn’t until I began exploring these low-level ideas during my internships that I realized how essential they are for solving real-world problems. My curiosity led me to ask questions like, _Why do we program in a certain way?_ _Why is this method better or more efficient than another?_ These types of questions require a solid understanding of the underlying low-level concepts. They push us to think critically about why we choose specific programming techniques, and how the choices we make can impact performance, scalability, and efficiency.

This blog is my way of sharing what I've learned while trying to answer these questions. My goal is to help myself and others gain a deeper understanding of low-level concepts and how they interconnect. I hope to make these fundamental concepts more accessible and inspire deeper questions about future learning. Through this process, I aim to encourage others to adopt better coding practices—not because they think they're better, but because they'll understand why they're better. As a result, these practices will become second nature to them.
