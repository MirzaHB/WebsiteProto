  "aboutMe": "When I first started my academic journey, I wasn't sure if software engineering was the right path for me. But as I got deeper into it, I realized how much I loved it. Instead of seeing the challenges as roadblocks, I saw them as exciting problems to solve. Late nights of coding and constant learning became my norm, and I developed a real passion for technology. Software engineering isn't just a job for me; it's a way to follow my passion. I'm excited to use technology to solve problems and make a difference in the world. As I enter my third year of pursuing a software engineering degree, I couldn't be happier with my decision to enter this field. What started as a tentative choice has blossomed into a true passion. Through a combination of coursework, personal projects, and even joining a club that builds and programs drones, I've gained invaluable hands-on experience that has fueled my love for software development.",
