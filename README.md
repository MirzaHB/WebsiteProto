This is me exploring Remix (with server-side rendering) by creating a personal website. This does not (yet) accurately represent my skills/knowledge. I know theres much to improve and created this in somewhat of a rush. As of right now, I'm just working on delivering more content for the website. In the future, I plan to make more performance improvements and have a better structure for the website overall.
